## 4. Design  <a name="design"></a> 

<br/>

### 1. Colour  Scheme  <a name="colourscheme"></a>

The colour scheme has primarily a green colour, research has shown that green has a strong link with health related topics and it also relates to nature and I felt it was a natural choice for the content of the site. I had used more colour earlier in the development, but I stripped it back in the end, as I thought simplicity was key in highlighting the content without too much distraction. The following image highlights the main colours in the site, and the colours are mostly variations within the green hues.

<br>
<p align ="center">      
   <img src="assets/readme/images/combo.png"  alt="Colour Combo" />        
</p>
<p align ="center">      
   #337920    #A3D31C    #274612    #7DD661    #47D31C    #0CAF46      
</p>
<br/> 

### 2. Typography    <a name="typography"></a>

Google Fonts were used within the website. The 'Roboto' font is the main font used for the whole project, both for regular text and headings. Sans serif is the fallback font in case the other font is not available. See below for example of font in use. The font color is #313131, which is a good font to help counter eye strain.

<br>
<p align ="center">      
   <img src="assets/readme/images/313131.png"  alt="general font for site" />        
</p>

<br>

The main title for the site and the navbar links use the 'Abril Fatface' font, A font it displays both neutrality and a strong presence on the page which helps to attract reader attention with the measured tension of its curves, good color and high contrast.

<br>
<p align ="center">      
   <img src="assets/readme/images/wannabetitle.png"  alt="wannabe title" />        
</p>

<br>

<p align ="center">      
   <img src="assets/readme/images/welcomefont.png"  alt="welcomefont" />        
</p>

<br>

Other Fonts were used within the Recipe Details Section and the main headings use the 'Marhey' Font, as it gives a certain quirky touch to the Recipes, that gives the recipes their own unique styles.

<br>

<p align ="center">      
   <img src="assets/readme/images/recipeheadings.png"  alt="recipeheadings" />        
</p>


<br>


### 3. Imagery    <a name="imagery"></a>

The Logo was created with [LogoMaker](https://www.logomaker.com/), as the theme was health related, I used predominantly green in the logo iteself and the logo had a strong influence on the overall website colour theme going forward.

The imagery of the site focuses on a healthy theme, the images were souced from the Pexels site and supplement either the blog or the recipe. The images are all self sourced, but the User can update images to supplement their own blogs/recipes for the site. The images for the site are hosted in [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/).

There are also images sporadically throughout the site, The home page has an image of a healthy woman, conveying a person with a healthy lifestyle. The about page again, shows a healthy woman living her best life and the information panels show images focuses on the main themes within the site.

There are also various icons used within the site, the icons were sourced at [Iconify.Design](https://iconify.design/), and they were used as a graphical representation of pertinent information on the site, they were used in conjunction with Forms or headings and were a subtle way to incorporate imagery on a limited scale, examples can be found in the image below.

I also created the favicon for the site with [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io)

<br>

<p align ="center">      
     <img src="assets/readme/images/logo.png" width="150" alt="Logo for Site" />

</p>

<br/>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/readme/images/icons.png" width="600" alt="Icons for Site"/>
</p>

<br>

### 4. Website Structure    <a name="structure"></a>

The website follows the standard website structure. The Logo and the website name are on the left hand side, and the naigation to the right, on the top of all pages. Within the Account Nav Link the user can either register or login to the site. When the user logs in they can see the Profile link and the logout button. The logged in user's image will also be visible. When the website is on smaller screens, there is a hamburger meu, with dropdown navigation items. The footer element is also available on all pages, with site information, contact details and social media icons.
 
 The website consists of the following Pages:
 - The Home Page, with an introduction to the site and holds the blog section and the search bar.
 - The Post Detail Page, that shows the information for individual blogs.
 - The Add Post Page, which is a form that allows the logged in User to add a blog.
 - The Edit Post Page, which is a form that allows the user to edit their own post.

### 5. Wireframes    <a name="wireframes"></a>

 ## 7. Future Implementation  <a name="future"></a>

 <br>

 The site in it's present form offers basic blog and recipe content, which is a good foundation but could be developed further to offer more options to the user. Within the blog area, I would like to add some features in future iterations such as adding favourites and highlighting the blogs that have received the most likes. 
 
 In regards to the recipes, there are a number of extra options I would like to introduce including vegetarian, and vegan recipes, the present recipes are not categorised in this way. I would like to also enhance the site by including information on food allergies, highlighting which recipes would have known allergens for the safety of the user. There could also be a dish of the week, as an incentive to users to submit their best recipes.
 
 I would like to introuduce more interaction into the site, possibly using a forum where users can document their own experiences when adopting a vegetarian/vegan lifestyle. This would increase the social aspect of the site and would fully utilize the social media platforms fully. 
 
 The present profiles could be expanded to include more information, such as the user's own links so that users can also interact with each other outside of the site. I was going to add blogs and recipes that the user has created within the profile page, but have not included this within the present project scope.
 
 At present there is no contact page and this would also be introduced, to encourage users to contact the web owner with messages, and it would be hoped their interaction would help the site owner to develop new ideas based on their suggestions. 

 The about page mentions relaxation as a factor, so I would like to add a section on the site dedicated to relaxation techniques and offering resources to the user in relation to stress relief and mindfulness.
 Within this area I could include video or audio resources for basic meditations that the user could try. I would also include links for further investigation, if they wanted to dig deeper into the subject area.

 ## 10. Bugs and Issues  <a name="bugs"></a>

 There have been various issues along the way, that I have resolved as they came up. 

<br>

 ### Resolved <a name="resolved"></a>

 When I first added profiles, I had the intention to include the profile image in the navbar when the user logged in, but when I used the code to allow this to happen, the image would not show. Up to this point I had not needed to to use content from one app within another, so that was a big issue. I talked with my mentor and I looked into the area of context processors, and added one within the blog app, but that did not fix the issue. Then after talking with Tutor Support I managed to resolve the issue, and the image showed up finally. Once I knew this was possible, I wanted to add Bio details of the user within in the blog detail and recipe detail pages.

<br>

<p align ="center">      
     <img src="assets/readme/images/showprofilepic.png" width="500" alt="views code for profile pic " />    
</p>

<br>


<p align ="center">      
     <img src="assets/readme/images/navprofileimage.png" width="500" alt="base code for profile image" />    
</p>

<br>

<p align ="center">      
     <img src="assets/readme/images/profilepicnav.png" width="200" alt="profile pic in nav" />    
</p>
 
 <br>

 <p align ="center">      
     <img src="assets/readme/images/picinblogdetail.png" width="600" alt="profile in blog detail page" />    
</p>

<br>

There was one further issue I noticed when testing, if you made a comment and submitted it, the user image in the blog_detail(and recipe detail) profile section would disappear, but this was due to a syntax error, and when it was fixed the problem was resolved.

I also had some issues when using the font awesome icons as some seemed unavailable due to restrictions of use, but used a different site for icons, and this has resolved that issue.

When testing I found I had an issued with the favicon, and had not included the webmanifest site or the selection of icons for mobile sites, so added these and they seem to be working ok. 

<br>

 ### Unresolved <a name="unresolved"></a>

 I did try near the end of the project to add the blogs and recipes that the user created to be included in the profile page, I experimented a little but decided to instead concentrate my focus on testing the functionality I had already achieved on the site, but have referred to this in [Future features](#7-future-implementation)

 Initially I was going to use primary key instead of slug, as it was causing issues when I tried to change the name of title/slug of a blog, but instead left it as slug, it does update the blog successfully, but instead of returning you to the amended blog, it returns to you to the main blog page, but the amendments are includeded and if you select the blog, you can open the amended site to see full details.

 ## 11. Deployment <a name="deployment"></a>

 The Project used Heroku for deployment. I used GitPod for development within the project and pushed to the GitHub Repository. This in turn updated the Project in Heroku. I used DEBUG = 'DEV' in os.environ, during development and other than testing, had it configured so that I could work both locally and could also test the deployed Project on an ongoing basis.

Code Institute

 ### Student Template <a name="studenttemplate"></a>
 This Template has been provided by the Code Institute and includes a number of tools to make life easier and has been used within this present site.    

<br/>

### Django Framework    <a name="djangoframework"></a>

I used the Resources and Lessons within the Full Stack Frameworks Module to get familiar with the concepts involved in created the present Project. In particular I did the walkthroughs for 'Hello Django' and 'I Think Therefore I Blog', and I uaed the cheatsheet, [Django Blog Cheat Sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P5CWvS5cYalkQOLeQiijpSViDPogtKM7ZGyqK-yehhQ/edit), which helped me set up the basic Django Project. I also looked at the for the 'Boutique Ado' walkthrough, as when I was creating the profile app, I wanted to see how it was handled within this project, It also helped me solidify some concepts that I had not grasped in the previous walkthrough.

<br>

Heroku

<br>

### Deploying to Heroku <a name="heroku"></a>
- After registering on the Heroku site, you can see the dashboard. You can select 'New' and then click 'Create new app'. You need to pick a unique name for your app, it will let you know if it is  to available to use.
- Select your region and create your app.
- Go to the settings tab and scroll until you find the config vars section and pick 'Reveal config vars',
in this case I added 'PORT' into the key field and added '8000' into the value field and click 'add'.
- If you have credentials, you must create another config vars called 'CREDS' and you would paste the JSON into the value field.
- You have to to the builldpacks section and click 'add buildpack'.
- In this case I added 'Python' and saved changes.
- Next you go to the Deploy tab and you select 'github' and confirm connection to your GitHub Account.
- You search for your project repository and click to 'connect'.
- Under the deploy options, you can chose automatic deploys, this allow you to automatically deploy each
time you push to your Repository.
- To deploy, you would choose what branch you want to deploy and click on 'Deploy Branch'.
- It takes a little time to build your app but when it is ready you can open your app by using the link provided.

<br>

### Changes in Heroku  <a name="herokuchanges"></a>

We received notifications that there was a change in their free plan and new charges would be introduces so we had to make changes in how our project would be deployed. At this point I had already deployed the site on Heroku, so needed to heed the advice from Code Institute and use the student plan, that had previously been set up, to apply for student credits. When these were applied, I changed the current free tier dynos I had to Eco Dynos on the site and migrated existing databases from postgress to ElephantSQL. To ensure this was done successfully, I attended the CI online webinar and followed the instructions in the CI cheat sheets in the following links:

[Sign up for ElephantSQL](https://code-institute-students.github.io/deployment-docs/02-elephantsql/elephantsql-01-sign-up)
  
[Migrating Databases](https://code-institute-students.github.io/deployment-docs/80-migrating-databases-for-heroku/)
